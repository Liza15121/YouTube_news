    "description":"It was recently reported  that Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had received over Rs 28,000 crore in the past six years. The state government sanctioned over Rs 8,000 crore in 2022-2023 alone. Over 60% of this money has been spent on road works, including flyovers and underpasses. Of the Rs 8, 000 crore sanctioned last year, Rs 6,000 crore is being spent on road works. BBMP has issued work orders for this Rs 6,000 crore in one go, even though the money is meant to be spent over three years. \n\nTo discuss these issues, Bengaluru Citizen Matters is organising a webinar, titled ‘The mysterious process of Bengaluru’s budget allocations’.",

This led to righteous outrage among citizens. Questions were raised not only about safety at the metro construction site but also of the roads in front of the Metro stations. How safe is it to cross the road to walk to the Metro stations? How challenging is it to commute to metro stations?",
